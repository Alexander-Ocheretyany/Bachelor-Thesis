# Balanced Partitioning of Graphs with Small Vertex Cover

The Balanced Partitioning problem is an important problem from the NP-class of problems,
that finds its practical applications in parallel computing, data mining, VLSI design, and others.
In the thesis we try to solve the problem practically using two kinds of algorithms -
a Fixed-Parameter Tractable Algorithm, and an Evolutionary Algorithm, providing the results
of many experiments performed.

Program - contains runnable program with the .exe extension (64-bit). Also, you can find the source code (C++) of the program.

Tests - contains all data of the experiments performed.
